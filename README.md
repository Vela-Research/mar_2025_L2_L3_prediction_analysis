This project focuses on identifying the most important features for individuals from the 'L2' and 'L3' categories, with the goal of predicting the success of their startups.

The "find_features" files utilize SHAP values and feature importance metrics from both Neural Networks and Random Forest Classifiers. Additional statistical tests are also applied to evaluate the significance of each feature. These selected features are then used in the "find_values" stage, where the model predicts startup outcomes and explores relationships between the variables.
